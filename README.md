### About the project

This is a website for a company specializing in making plastic windows. The page shows available products, allows customers to calculate the approximate price for a certain window and send a callback request.

There is also a [`node.js` back-end](https://github.com/a-sapon/window-service-back) that sends the information about the customer and the selected window from a submit-form "Оставить заявку" to a group in Telegram.

You can see the live project at [window-service.com.ua](https://window-service.com.ua/).
